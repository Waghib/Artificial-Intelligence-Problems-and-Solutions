poem = """
In realms of code where circuits gleam,
\tA dance of minds, a digital dream.
Silicon whispers, circuits hum,
\tIn the heart of algorithms, futures drum.

Lines of logic weave tales untold,
\tIn the binary language, stories unfold.
Bits and bytes, a cosmic art,
\tArtificial minds, a symphony's start.
